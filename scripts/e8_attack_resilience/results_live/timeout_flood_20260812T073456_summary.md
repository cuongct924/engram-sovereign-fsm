# LIVE Timeout-flooding test

docs/EXPERIMENT.md's E8 "Timeout flooding by Byzantine nodes" row -- node04 stays alive and honest everywhere else, but actively floods genuinely signed Timeout messages every 50ms (engram-consensus-core's timeoutFloodRoutine), instead of the crash-only (`chaos-crash`) approximation used previously.

Total duration: 126s.

## Verdict

- Safety held (3 honest nodes' AppHash never diverged): **True**
- Divergence events: 0
- Cadence held (flood-phase height rate >= 50% of baseline): **True**
  - baseline: 0.661 blocks/s
  - flood:    0.816 blocks/s
  - recovery: 0.769 blocks/s
